This website has been 4 years in the making. A long 4 years filled with dead ends and procrastination. 
### [Wordpress absolutely sucks](https://hackernoon.com/this-is-why-wordpress-sucks-and-you-should-probably-stop-using-it-v697y30v7)
For some reason, even with all the one click install solutions, auto-management plugins which add bloatware, one thing never changes.

**Wordpress just sucks**.

Things are constantly breaking, the one theme you like is either out of date or they now want money or they'll hide the best features of the theme that made you like it in the first place.

Wordpress is also, at it's core, a blogging platform. Try to do anything even slightly different, and you'll run into problem after problem. It's like trying to fight the government for their archaic laws; there's no winning.

So I wanted to be able to switch out of wordpress -because who likes wordpress anymore anyway- and make a website that could not just act as a short portfolio, but also house a rudimentary blog.

The only thing was that while Grav is amazing for creating simple sites with a lot of static content, it's HORRIBLE for blogs. I had to find a theme I liked not just for the landing page, but something that would work well for putting up blog posts. Maybe not to the degree of a full blog site, but something that I could call my own.

I feel I have finally reached that goal and my [old blog](https://archive.aashishvasudevan.com) can finally be retired.
Don't actually click that link, it doesn't really work.
