This website has been 4 years in the making. I wanted to be able to switch out of wordpress -because who likes wordpress anymore- and make a website that could not just act as a short portfolio, but also house a rudimentary blog. The only thing was that while Grav is amazing for creating simple sites with a lot of static content, it's HORRIBLE for blogs. I had to find a theme I liked not just for the landing page, but something that would work well for putting up blog posts. Maybe not to the degree of a full blog site, but something that I could call my own.

I feel I have finally reached that goal and my [old blog](https://archive.aashishvasudevan.com) can finally be retired. Don't actually click that link, it doesn't really work.
